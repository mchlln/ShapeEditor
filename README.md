# Shape Editor

This project was developed as an assignment in the Software Architecture class at the University of Bordeaux.

## Overview

This project is a vector drawing editor that allows users to create, edit, and combine geometric figures.
The editor provides an interactive whiteboard where users can place objects, group them, modify their properties,
and manage them via drag-and-drop. It also supports undo/redo operations, document saving/loading, and persistence of the toolbar state.

The implementation relies exclusively on Java AWT for the graphical user interface.

The goal of this assignment is to apply as many design patterns as possible in order to improve reusability,
extensibility, and maintainability, while practicing the architectural concepts studied in class.

## Used Design Patterns

- Singleton
- Bridge
- Memento
- Prototype
- Builder
- Composite
- Visitor
- Method Factory
- Observer
- Command + Bag of Commands
